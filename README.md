This project is a quiz management system developed in Java using Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface. The system consists of four frames: Login, Rules, Quiz, and Score. It facilitates conducting quizzes with 10 questions, each having 4 options, with each correct answer carrying 10 points. Additionally, there is a timer set for 15 seconds for each question.

A unique feature of this system is the "50-50" lifeline, which allows the user to eliminate two incorrect options from a question. However, this lifeline can only be used once throughout the entire quiz.
